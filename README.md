This project focuses on real-time accident detection by combining the power of YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8) for object detection and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accident classification.
The system processes live video streams, detects vehicles, and identifies potential accidents based on vehicle behavior and crash patterns.

Key Features:

YOLOv8 is used to detect vehicles, road elements, and anomalies in real-time.
CNN is trained to classify frames into "Accident" and "Non-Accident" categories based on extracted features.
Real-time processing on video feeds or CCTV footage to enable fast response.
High accuracy through the combination of spatial (YOLOv8) and temporal (CNN) information.
Scalable and modular design for easy deployment in smart cities or traffic monitoring systems.
